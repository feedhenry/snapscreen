# Onconnect Movies API
Node library around the Onconnect movies API (http://developer.tmsapi.com/page). You need an API key to use this library.

## Usage

`OnconnectAPI.init` receives the API key. You will need to call this method (once) before calling any other method.

`OnconnectAPI.getMoviesByLocation` receives a latitude, a longitude and a callback. It will call the callback passing the list of the movies playing today nearby your location.

var OnconnectAPI = require('onconnect-movies-api')

OnconnectAPI.init('<YOUR_API_KEY>');
OnconnectAPI.getMoviesByLocation('34.0386656','-118.4221519',function(movies){
  //Implement your code here
});
```
